Hi there, I’m Michalle, a software engineer!

🎓 I graduated college with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science in 2021. I recently decided to attend General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp to learn more technologies and advance in my problem solving, debugging, and full-stack skills.

✨ I'm passionate about debugging code and solving problems!

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything!
